	<p class="lead">Hey! this is just a toy, <strong>DON'T USE IT FOR SERIOUS WORK</strong> for your own sake</p>
	<p>I've limited the number of urls you can check to 500 at a time. An email will be sent to you after the check is done. Feel free to post any issue or make some improvements on the <a href="https://github.com/pleasedontbelong/http_code_responses">github repository</a>.</p>
	<p>If you want to know more about your website you could use a more serious tool like <a href="http://www.botify.com">Botify</a>.</p>
